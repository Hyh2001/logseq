ROS node is the process that use ROS APIs to perform computations. There are four types of ROS nodes:[[publisher node]], [[subscriber node]], [[client node]],[[server node]]. The nodes are created by using [[ROS client libraries]].  After finishing programming a node, we need to write Ros [[CMakelists.txt]] and using catkin_make to compile it. The preliminaries of using ROS nodes is to open the [[ROS master]] at first. 
# [[ROS node]] commands
We can perform works like [[listing active nodes]], [[providing information of nodes]], [[running nodes]] and etc.
