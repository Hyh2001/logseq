# method
1. the first stage in the analysis of a sentence is to divide it into two main parts—the Subject and the Predicate
2. chief word in the complete Subject is called the Subject-word or Simple Subject
3. Subject-word is qualified by an [[adjective]] or Adjective-equivalent* called its Enlargement or Attribute
4. Predicate may consist of one word or several words. When the Predicate consists of one word that word is always a Verb
5. the Verb in the Predicate may be qualified by an Adverb or Adverb-equivalent* , called, in analysis, its Extension or Adverbial Qualification
6. Sometimes the Verb in the Predicate is an Intransitive Verb of Incomplete Predication, that is, an Intransitive Verb which requires a Noun, or an Adjective, or a Pronoun. Complement of an Intransitive Verb serves to describe the Subject, and is therefore called a Subjective Complement
