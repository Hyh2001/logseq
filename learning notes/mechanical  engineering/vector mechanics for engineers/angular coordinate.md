From the picture below, we can see that the position both of P and of the entire body is completely defined by the angle $\theta$  that the line $BP$ forms with the $zx$ plane. And we defined this angle as *angular coordinate* of the body. We define that it is positive when viewed as counterclockwise form $A^{'}$. The unit of this coordinate is rad, which 
$1$ rev = $2\pi$ rad = $360\degree$
