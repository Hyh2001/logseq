1. recursion function
2. zk is observation and vk is noise

### aim
to get good estimation of xk(which means to get **a**,**xk-1**)

there are also [[process noise]],as a result,xk can be

### state estimation

to deal with noise which is unpredictable. 
We can estimate as a tradeoff between previous estimate and the current observation.

gk is called [[gain]]

## why?
