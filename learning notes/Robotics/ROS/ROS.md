ROS is a free and open source robotics software framework that is used in both commercial and research applications. ROS has many functions and features(see [[ROS functions]]).
# ROS architecture
[[ROS architecture]] is shown in the file. Through the architecture, data will flow between [[ROS node]]s which can even be on different computers. 
# ROS working space 
Inside a working space, there are many folders and files. The structure and operations of the ROS working space is as follow. See ([[ROS working space]])
# ROS package
Inside the [[src folder]] of [[ROS working space]]s, we can see [[ROS package]]s. They are the organization unit of ROS codes. The structure of [[ROS package]]s are as follow.(see [[ROS package]]) There is also a special [[ROS package]] called [[ROS metapackage]]. It is used to store multiple [[ROS package]] and group them. 
# [[ROS node]]
We can build several nodes indies a package. [[ROS node]]s are the smallest working units. Its structure can be seen in [[ROS node]]. Both [[Rospy]] and [[Roscpp]] have APIs for building nodes.
