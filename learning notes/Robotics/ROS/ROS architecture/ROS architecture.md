# ROS architecture
Its structure includes [[ROS master]], [[ROS node]]s, [[ROS topic]]s and [[ROS message]]s. Message transferring process will be controlled by [[ROS master]]. Two way are used to transfer [[ROS message]]s. 
1. The first way is to use [[publisher node]] and [[subscriber node]]. [[ROS message]]s will be wrapped in [[ROS topic]]s. Then the messages will be sent from [[publisher node]] to [[subscriber node]]. 
2. The second way is to use [[server node]] and [[client node]]. [[Client node]] will send message to call for [[ROS service]]s. [[Server node]] will execute the service and give back the results in the form of [[ROS message]].
