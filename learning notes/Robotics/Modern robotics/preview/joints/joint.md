The mechanical parts to joint several [[link]]s together. There may be some [[sensor]]s at the joints to measure force, torque, displacement and speed. Cameras are also introduced for measuring color and depth. 
# understanding of joints:
There are two ways to view a joint and they are as below:
1. View a joint as providing freedoms to allow one rigid body to move relative to another rigid body 
2. View a joint as a constraint on motion of two rigid bodies it connects

# joints in Robot 
There are several types of joints that can be commonly found in robots and they are as follow:
## with one [[degree of freedom]] 
### [[Revolute joint]]
### [[Prismatic joint]]
### [[Helical joint]]
## with multiple [[degree of freedom]] 
### [[cylindrical joint]]
### [[universal joint]]
### [[spherical joint]]
