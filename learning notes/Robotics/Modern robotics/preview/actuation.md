Actuation is the process that causes the robot to move and exert forces in desired ways. The object that finish the process is called [[actuator]]. It is typically given by motors, shape memory alloys or pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders.  For ideal electric motors, low rotational speed and large forces and torques will be generated with the reality that fast speed and low forces and torques are provided. Thus *transformers* like gears, cable drives, belts and pulleys are introduced to *lower the speed and amplify the force*.  For the transformers, they should have zero or low [[slippage]] and [[backlash]].
