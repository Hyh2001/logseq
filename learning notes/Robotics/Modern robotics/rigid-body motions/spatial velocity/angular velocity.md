With the definition of [[angular coordinate]], we still look at the picture in that page. we can see that the linear velocity of point $p$ is $v = \frac{ds}{dt} = r\dot{\theta}sin\phi$ numerically, and the direction of [[vector]] $\vec{v}$ is perpendicular to the plane contains $AA^{''}$ and $\vec{r}$, we can see that $\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = \vec{\omega} \times \vec{r}$. Thus we define the angular velocity as $\vec{\omega} = \omega\vec{k} = \dot{\theta}\vec{k}$
