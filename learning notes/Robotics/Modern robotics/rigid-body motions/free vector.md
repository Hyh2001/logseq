A free vector is a geometric quantity with a length and a direction. It is denoted as "v"  Think of it as an arrow in $R^n$. It is called “free” because it is not necessarily rooted anywhere. If we choose a reference frame for it, the base of the arrow will be the origin of the frame. Then the free vector "v" can be represented by its coordinate in the reference frame as $v$. "v" is coordinate free and $v$ is coordinate dependent.
