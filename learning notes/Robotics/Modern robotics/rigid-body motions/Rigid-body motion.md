A rigid-body motion is a continuous movement of the particles in the object such that the distance between any two particles remains fixed at all times.$^{[2]}$ This motion will generate a *rigid-body displacement*.$^{[2]}$ We achieve the representation of the rigid-body motion by attaching a reference frame to the body. We can represent this frame as a $4 \times 4$ matrix. It is an implicit representation method which $10$-constraints will be applied to the $16$-dimensional space of the matrix. The matrix has more usages. 
1. It can be used to translate or rotate a [[vector]] or a frame 
2. It can be used to change the representation of a vector or a frame from coordinates in one frame to coordinates in another frame. 
# representation of a rigid body’s velocity
We can use [[spatial velocity]] to represent a rigid body's velocity.
