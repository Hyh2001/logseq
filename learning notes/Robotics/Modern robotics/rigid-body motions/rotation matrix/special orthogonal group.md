It is the set of all $3 \times 3$ real [[Matrix]] $R$ satisfying the properties list below. It can be denoted as $SO(3)$. Also, for two dimensions, the [[special orthogonal group]] becomes $SO(2)$ which is the set of all $2 \times 2$ real [[Matrix]] $R$ satisfying the properties list below
# properties 
1. inverse: $R^TR = I$ 
2. closure: $R_1R_2 \in SO(3)$
3. associative: $(R_1R_2)R_3 = R_1(R_2R_3)$
4. not commutative: $R_1R_2 \neq R_2R_1$
5. for $x \in \mathbb{R}^3, ||Rx|| = ||x||$
6. $det R = 1$
