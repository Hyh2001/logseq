The matrix that used to represent the orientation of a [[frame]] or rotate it to another orientation. It is a 3 by 3 [[Matrix]] with 6 constraints provided. Column vectors are all unit [[vector]]s and they are [[Orthogonal]] to each other. Based on the constraints, we can have properties: 
1. $R^TR = I$ 
2. $det[R] = 1$
We call the set of all rotation matrices as [[special orthogonal group]] 
# The three applications of rotation matrices
1. [[represent an orientation of a frame]]
2. [[change reference frame]]
3. [[rotate a vector or frame]]
