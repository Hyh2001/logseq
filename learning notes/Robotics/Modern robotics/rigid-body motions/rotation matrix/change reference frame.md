We denote a frame $\{c\}$ relative to $\{b\}$ by the following:
$q = \begin{bmatrix} q_x \\ q_y \end{bmatrix}$, $Q_{bc} = \begin{bmatrix} cos\alpha & -sin\alpha \\ sin\alpha & cos\alpha \end{bmatrix}$
To know the [[configuration]] of $\{c\}$ relative to $\{s\}$ we can:
$R_{sc} = P_{sb}Q_{bc}$    in which $P_{sb}$ is denoted as the [[rotation matrix]] of frame $\{b\}$ relative to $\{s\}$
$r = Pq + p$
