We can use implicit representation which views the $n$-dimensional space as embedded in a Euclidean space of more than $n$ dimensions. It uses the coordinates of the higher-dimensional space. We will use [[rotation matrix]] to represent orientation of objects. ([[unit quaternion]] is another method.)
### advantages 
1. no singularities will show in the representation. 
2. For [[closed-chain mechanism]]s, it may be hard to construct [[explicit parametrization]] but it is easy to find an [[implicit differentiation]]: the set of all joint coordinates subject to the [[loop-closure equation]]s that define the closed loops. 
### disadvantages 
1. the representation has more numbers than the number of [[degree of freedom]].
