*Consider a mechanism consisting of $N$ links, where ground is also regarded as a link. Let $J$ be the number of joints, $m$ be the number of degrees of freedom of a rigid body ($m =3$ for planar mechanisms and $m =6$ for spatial mechanisms),$f_i$ be the number of freedoms provided by joint $i$,and $c_i$ be the number of constraints provided by joint $i$(the constraints should be independent between each joints), where $f_i + c_i = m$ for all $i$. Then, 
dof = $m(N-1) - \sum_{i = 1}^J c_i = m(N-1-J) + \sum_{i=1}^J f_i$*
# overlap joints
This formula is true only when all joint constraints are independent, if not, then [[Grubler's formula]] only provides a lower bound on the [[degree of freedom]]s. Therefore for overlapping joints: joints that connect more than two [[link]]s, we need to treat it as several joints overlaps each other
