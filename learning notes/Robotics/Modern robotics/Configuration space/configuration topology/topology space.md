a topological space is a [[set]] whose elements are called [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)"), along with an additional structure called a [[topology]]. 
# one-dimensional spaces 
There are several types of one-dimensional spaces: 
1. circle($S$)
2. line($\mathbb{E}$)(It equals to a line with open interval) and 
3. a closed interval of the line($[a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R}$ means a point in $\mathbb{E}$) Also $n$-dimensional spaces.
# two-dimensional spaces
1. plane($\mathbb{E}^2$)
2. sphere($S^2$)
3. torus($T^2 = S^1 * S^1$)
4. sphere($E^1 * S^1$)
# n-dimensional spaces 
$\mathbb{R}^n$ is the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. $S^n$ is the $n$-dimensional surface of a sphere in $(n+1)$-dimensional space
