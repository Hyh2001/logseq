It is a specification of the configurations that the end-effector of the robot can reach$^{[1]}$. Another definition is like a set of possible points it can reach$^{[2]}$. It is independent of task. A point inside the [[workspace]] may be achievable by more than one robot configuration, meaning that the point is not a full specification of the robot’s configuration. All the points in the workspace is reachable by at least one [[configuration]].
