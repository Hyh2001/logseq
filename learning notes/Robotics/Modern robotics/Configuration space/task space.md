The [[configuration space]] of robots' [[end effector]]s . It is a space in which the robot's task can be naturally expressed$^{[1]}$. (Another definition is like that task space is the space of all possible end-effector poses$^{[2]}$. ==you can see from the two definitions that there are conflicts between them.==) It is independently of the robot.  A point in task space may be achievable by more than one robot configuration, meaning that the point is not a full specification of the robot’s configuration. Some points in the task space are unreachable.  


==If a only one configuration can be used to reach each point in a task space, then the dimension of a task space equals to the degrees of freedom.==
