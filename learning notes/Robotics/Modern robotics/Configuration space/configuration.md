It is a complete specification of the positions of all points of the robot. It can be represented by several numbers. The smallest number of numbers need is called [[degree of freedom]]. 
# representation of configuration 
A rigid-body [[configuration]] can be achieved by starting from the fixed reference frame and integrating a constant [[spatial velocity]]  for a specified time. By observations, arbitrary motions can be represented by screw motions and based on this inspection, we can have [[learning notes/Robotics/Modern robotics/rigid-body motions/exponential coordinate]]s to represent [[configuration]] of a rigid body.
