Legged robot provide improved mobility over rough terrain. This type of robots are more complex and the main problem is to prevent falling. 
# developing period
## pre-robotics 
This era lacks digital computers and thus lacks feedback control. 
## digital control 
start in late 1960s. All the robot in this era limits to quasi-static gaits. 
## dynamic locomotion
In 1980s, transition to dynamic legged locomotion. In late 1980s, passive dynamic model is generated

# remaining problems
1. How to make them run efficiently?
2. energy
3. speed
4. reactivity
5. versatility
6. robustness
