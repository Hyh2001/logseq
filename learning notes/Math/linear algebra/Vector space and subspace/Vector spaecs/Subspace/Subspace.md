# definition
A set of vectors that satisfies two requirements that for two vectors $v$ and $w$ ,  $v+w$ and $cv$ are still in the sub space. ($c$ is a scalar)
## properties
1. Every sub space contains zero vector.
2. Contains all the linear combinations of $v$ and $w$ 
## dimension of a subspace
The number of vectors in any [[Basis]] is the dimension of the space. 
## four subspaces
### properties
1. Dimension of four subspaces ([[Nullspace]],[[Left nullspace]],[[Column space]],[[Row space]]) $C(A) = C(A^T) = r$ $N(A) = n-r,N(A^T)=m-r$
## applications
1. Bases for matrix spaces and function spaces
