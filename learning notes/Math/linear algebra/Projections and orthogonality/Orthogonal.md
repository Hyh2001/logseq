# definition
For two vectors, if they are [[Orthogonal]], it means that $x^Ty = 0$ 

## properties
1. $||x||^2 + ||y||^2 = |||x + y||^2$
2. 0 vector is orthogonal to every vectors
## orthogonality four subspaecs
Subspace S is orthogonal to subspace T, if every vector in S is orthogonal to every vector in T 
### consider four subspaces
1. [[Row space]] is orthogonal to [[Nullspace]]:
Prove:  For $Ax = 0$ each row of A times x equals 0 which means they are orthogonal to each other
3. [[Column space]] is orthogonal to [[Left nullspace]]:
Prove: For $A^Ty = 0$ each rows of $A^T$ are columns of $A$  And they are   orthogonal to $y$ . 
## orthogonal complements 
An orthogonal complement to a subspace contains all the vectors orthogonal to it.
