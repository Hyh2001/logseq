# definition 
For $Ax = \lambda x$ , $\lambda$ is a multiple of $x$ and is called eigenvalues
## properties
1.If $\lambda = 0$, then $x$ is the [[Nullspace]] of $A$ 
2.sum of eigenvalues equal to the trace of $A$
3.for symmetric matrix, eigenvalues are real numbers 
4.for anti-symmetric matrix, eigenvalues are pure imaginary numbers
5.add $nI$ to $A$ will cause eigenvalues become $(\lambda+n)x$  
6.product of eigenvalues equal to the determinant
7.for a triangular matrix, their eigenvalues are on their diagonals
8.eigenvalues of $A^2$ are $\lambda ^2$
9.tell us the growth rate of a dynamic problem
## find of eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
### for a projection matrix
Eigenvectors are the vectors that 
#### 1.in the plane
And eigenvalues are 1 
#### 2.are perpendicular to the plane
And eigenvalues are 0  
### for all matrix
$(A-\lambda I)x = 0$
And $A-\lambda I$ must be singular for $x$ is not only zero vectors
#### characteristic equation
$det(A-\lambda I) = 0$
#### solve for $\lambda$
$\lambda$ can be repeated
#### solve for $x$ 
Back substitute $\lambda$
