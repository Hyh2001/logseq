# steps
1. Transform $\begin {bmatrix} A & b \end{bmatrix}$ to $\begin {bmatrix} R & d \end{bmatrix}$ 
2. In R, choose free variables to zero and we will get one particular solution $x_p$
3. The solution type is like $x_p + x_n$
4. To find $x_n$ we need to find $Ax_n = 0$, we set each free column to be 1 and others to be zero and iteratively we will get $n-r$  vectors and they are our solutions
## when there is no solution?
$b$ is not inside the column space of $A$ 
## How to solve Ax =b if there is no solution to it
### real meanings:
We have much more equations then unknowns, and there may be noises inside. 
### method:
Use matrix $A^TAx^\hat{} = A^Tb$
( ==why can we use this matrix?==)
#### properties of it 
1.[[Square matrix]]
2.[[Symmetric matrix]]:
prove: $(A^TA)^T = A^TA$
1.$N(A^TA) = N(A)$
2.Rank($A^TA$) = Rank(A)
3.$A^TA$ is invertible exaclty if A has independent columns :                               prove: we need to prove that if $A^TAx = 0$ only if $x = 0$
$x^TA^TAx = 0 = (Ax)^T(Ax) = 0$ means that $Ax = 0$ and for $A$ are invertible we can get that $x = 0$
