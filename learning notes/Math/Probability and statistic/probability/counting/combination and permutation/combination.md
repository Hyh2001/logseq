The definition of combination is as follow. The number of combinations of $n$ distinct objects taken $r$ at a time is
$C^{n}_{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
$0 \leq r \leq n$

# properties
There are some properties of combinations and they are as follow:
1. $C^{n}_{r} = C^{n}_{n-r}$
2. $P^{n}_{r} = C^{n}_{r}  \cdot P^{r}_{r}$

# excel 
We can use excel to help us calculate combinations. The usage of excel is as follow. 
``` excel
COMBIN(number,number_chosen)
```
