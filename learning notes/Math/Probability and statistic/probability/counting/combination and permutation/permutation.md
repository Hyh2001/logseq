Permutation is defined as follow. A permutation of $n$ distinct elements taken $r$ at a time is an arrangement of the $r$ elements. ==It is a [[counting]] that the order matters.== Its calculation formula is represented as follow.
# calculation formula 
$P^{n}_{r} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

If typically the data drawn is needed to be arranged into a circle, the situation will be as follow: 
# arrange in circle
The number of permutations of $n$ distinct objects arranged in a circle is $(n − 1)!$

We can use excel to calculate permutations. The function us as follow:
# excel
```excel
PERMUTATIONA(number,number_chosen)
```
