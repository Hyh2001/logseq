Counting can be defined as follow. In general, if $n$ operations $O_1, O_2, · · · , O_n$ are performed in order, with possible number of outcomes $n_1, n_2, · · · , n_k$ respectively, then there are $n_1n_2 · · · n_k$ possible combined outcomes of the operations performed in the given order. This is also the basic principle of counting. There are two types of countings which based on whether ordered arrangements will include in the counting. They are [[permutation]] and [[combination]].
