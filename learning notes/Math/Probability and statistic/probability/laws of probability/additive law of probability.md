# definition
The probability of the union of two events $A$ and $B$ is 
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events, $P(A \cap B) = 0$ and 
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

## theorem
$P(A) = 1 - P(\bar{A})$
### proof
$S = A \cup \bar{A}$. Thus $P( A \cup \bar{A}) = P(S) = 1$ 
For $A$ and $\bar{A}$ are exclusive, then $P(A \cup \bar{A}) = P(A) + P(\bar{A}) = 1$
