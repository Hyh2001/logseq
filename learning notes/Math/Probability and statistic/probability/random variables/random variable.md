Random variable is a real-valued functions defined on the sample space.

## understanding of random variables
We can understand random variable in this way. Taking an experiment as an example. The process we observe the value of a sample is *random variable*, the number we measured is *numerical value*. 

## why we need random variables?
Sometimes our interest is mainly in some function of the outcomes rather than the outcome itself, thus we can use [[random variable]] to denote the function. 

## types of random variables 
There are two types of [[random variable]]s, the first is [[Discrete random variable]] and the second is [[Continuous random variable]]. 

## properties of random variables 
We use [[expected value]] and [[variance]] to assess a random distribution.
