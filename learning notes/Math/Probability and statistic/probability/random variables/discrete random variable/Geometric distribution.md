Geometric distribution is a distribution that has a probability mass function as follow. 
$P(x = n) = (1-p)^{n-1}p$, $p$ is the probability of success. Its [[expected value]] and [[variance]] are as follow. 
# [[expected value]] of Geometric distribution 
$u = \frac{1}{p}$
# [[variance]]  of Geometric distribution
$V(x) = \frac{1-p}{p^2}$
