A random variable that can take on at most a countable number of possible values us said to be discrete and this type of random variable is called discrete random variable. For a discrete random variable $X$, we define the *probability mass function* $p(a)$ Of $X$ as 
$p(a) = P\{X=a\}$
There are several types of discrete random variables. They are as follow.
# types of Discrete random variable 
## 1. [[Binomial distribution]] 
## 2.[[Hypergeometric distribution]] 
## 3. [[Poisson distribution]] 
## 4. [[Geometric distribution]]

# combine into one
