# Bernoulli trial
## properties
1. For each trial, there are only two possible outcomes, "success" and "fail".
2. For each trial, the probability of success $p$ is constant
3. Repeated Bernoulli trials are independent 

# binomial trial
$n$ Bernoulli trials. 
## [[expected value]]  of Binomial distribution 
$E[X] = np$
## [[variance]]  of Binomial distribution
$V[X] = np(1-p)$
