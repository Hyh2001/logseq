The probability density function of exponential distribution is as follow.
$f(X) = {\begin{aligned}\lambda e^{-\lambda x} , x \geq 0 \\ 0 , x < 0 \end{aligned}}$
It is a special form of [[Gamma distribution]] when $\alpha = 1$ and $\lambda = \frac{1}{\beta}$ 
# real-world meaning
It is often arises as the distribution of the amount of time until some specific event occurs. 
## [[expected value]] of Exponential distribution
$E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda}$
## [[variance]] of  Exponential distribution
$V[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda ^2}$
# Exponential distribution and [[Poisson distribution]]
