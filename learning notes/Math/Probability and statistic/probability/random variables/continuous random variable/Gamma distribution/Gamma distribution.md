Then definition of Gama distribution is as follow. 
A [[random variable]] $Y$ is saint to have a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta > 0$ if and only if the density function of $Y$ is 
$f(y) = {\begin{aligned}\frac{y^{\alpha-1}e^{-y/\beta}}{\beta ^\alpha \gamma(\alpha)} , y \geq 0 \\ 0 , y < 0 \end{aligned}}$
$\gamma(\alpha)$ is the [[Gamma function]]

# snape of the [[probability density function]] 
Most of the area under the density function is located near the origin.

## shape parameter ($\alpha$)
The shape of the distribution is determined by the parameter $\alpha$. With $\alpha$ differs, shape differs.
## scale parameter($\beta$)
The scale of the distribution is determined by the parameter $\beta$. With $\beta$ differs, scale differs.
# real-world meaning
This distribution is used to approximate time before some process occurs.
# the [[expected value]]  of [[Gamma distribution]] 
$E[Y] = \alpha\beta$
## proof
$E[Y] =
# the [[variance]] of [[Gamma distribution]] 
$V[Y] = \alpha \beta^2$
