For $X$ is normally distributed (see [[Normal distribution]] ) with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$, then $Z = (X - \mu)/\sigma$ is normally distributed with parameters 0 and 1. Also, 0 is the [[expected value]] of this distribution and 1 is the [[variance]] of this distribution. There are two types of problems relevant to standard normal distribution. The first type is about given $x$ to find probability and the other type is about given probability and find $x$. We can use excel to help us solve these two types if problems. 
# excel
## Problem 1
We can use the excel function 
```excel 
NORM.S.DIST(z,cumulative)
```
## Problem 2
We can use excel function 
```excel
NORM.INV (probability, Mean, standard_dev)
```
