When $n$ is large, a [[Binomial distribution]]  with parameters $n$ and $p$ will have approximately the same distribution as a [[Normal distribution]]. This approximation will be quite good if $\sigma^2 = np(1-p) \geq 10$$^{[1]}$ Or $n > 20$ and $np > 5$$^{[2]}$

For $^{[1]}$, it is from the book *"the first class in probability"*
For$^{[2]}$, it is from the book *"mathematical statistic with applications"*
