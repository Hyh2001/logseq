We say that $X$ is a continuous random variable if there exists a nonnegative [[function]] $f$, called [[probability density function]] defined for all real $x \in (-\infty,\infty)$, having the property that for any set $B$ of real numbers 
$P(x \in B) = \int_B f(x)dx$

## 2. [[exponential distribution]]
