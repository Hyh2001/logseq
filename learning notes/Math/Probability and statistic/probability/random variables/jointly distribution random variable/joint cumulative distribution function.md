For joint cumulative distribution functions (In $^{[2]}$, it is also named as joint distribution functions) , we can define them as $F(x,y) = P(X \leq x,Y \leq y) -\infty < x,y < \infty$ $P$ is the joint distribution. 
==$\leq$ means that we also need to consider boundary points which may affect discrete types==. There are several properties of joint cumulative distribution functions.
