When both $X$ and $Y$ are [[Discrete random variable]]s, we can get the joint [[probability mass function]] as: 
$p(x,y) = P(X =x,Y=y)$
We can also get probability mass function of $X$ or $Y$ individually. This can be called [[marginal distribution]]. We can also define [[conditional distribution]] for joint distribution random variables. Also, the idea of [[statistically independent]] can also be derived.
