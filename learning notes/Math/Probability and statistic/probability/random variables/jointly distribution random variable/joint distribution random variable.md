Joint distribution random variable is a structure concerning two or more random variables. They can be both [[discrete random variable]] or [[Continuous random variable]]. We can define [[joint cumulative distribution function]] for both discrete and continuous types. 
# discrete type
We can define [[joint probability function]] for discrete types. Based on the function defined above, we can define [[marginal probability function]] for measuring the probability of a single [[random variable]] and [[conditional discrete probability function]] for characterizing the relationship between these two random variables. If they are [[Independent joint random variable]] , thus they need to satisfy the properties listed. If they are dependent, we use [[covariance]] to determine the degree. [[expected value of joint random variable]] can be defined to predict the outcome of the event. 

# continuous type 
We define [[joint density function]]s for continuous types. 
and  [[marginal density function]] and [[conditional density function]] for continuous types. 



can be thus defined. In order to
