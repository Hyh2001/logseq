Let X and Y be two random variables, discrete or continuous, with joint probability distribution $f (x, y)$ and marginal distribution $g(x)$ and $h(y)$, respectively. The random variables $X$ and $Y$ are said to be statistically independent if and only if 
$f(x,y) = g(x) \cdot h(y)$
for all $(x,y)$ in the range.
