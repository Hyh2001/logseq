Probability is a measure of one’s belief in the occurrence of a future event. A science of identifying essential patterns that occur in [[random event]]s. We define it as follow.  To every [[event]]  $A$ in $S$([[sample space]]) ($A$ is a subset of $S$) , we assign a number, $P(A)$, the *probability* of $A$. There are three approaches to view a probability. They are as follow: 
## three approaches (understand of probability)
There are three approaches to probability and they are as follow:
1. [[classical approach]]
2. [[relative-frequency approach]]
3. [[subjective approach]]

# axioms of probability
There are several properties of  this assigned number $P(A)$, they are called *axioms of probability*. They are as follow: 
[[axioms of probability]]
## calculation law of probability 
Based on the axiom above, some [[Proposition]]s can be proposed:
1. For mutually [[complementary event]]( exclusive event), $P(S) = P(E \cup E^{'}) = 1$ 
2. To calculate the sum of two events, we can have [[additive law of probability]].
3. To calculate the intersect of two events, we can have [[multiplicative law of probability]] 
To calculate the probability of a single event, there are two methods: 
1. [[event-composition method]]
2. [[sample-point method]]

## [[conditional probability]]
There is type of probability which is the probability of an event based on the occurrence of another event. (See [[conditional probability]] ) 

## [[Baye‘s rule]] 
We can use [[Baye‘s rule]] to divide an event into several parts which are its intersection with other events. 

## [[random variable]] 
Random variable is a powerful tool. We can use it to represent more events which are the function of several outcomes.
