# types of events
There are several types of events. They are as follow: 
## [[simple event]]
## [[compound event]]
## [[random event]] 
a set of basic outcomes from the sample space, and it is said to occur if the random experiment gives rise to one of the basic outcomes.
## [[complementary event]]
If $E$ is any event in the sample space, $E ^{'}$ is the event “E does not occur”, then $E ^{'}$ is the complementary event of $E$
## [[independent event]]
