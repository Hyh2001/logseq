This method is used to calculate [[probability]]. We can expresses [[event]] $A$ as a composition involving unions and/or intersections of other events. The laws of probability are then applied to find $P(A)$.

## steps
1. Define the experiment. 
2. Visualize the nature of the sample points. Identify a few to clarify your thinking. 
3. Write an equation expressing the event of interest—say, $A$—as a composition of two or more events, using unions, intersections, and/or complements. (Notice that this equates point sets.) Make certain that event $A$ and the event implied by the composition represent the same set of sample points.  ==we should choose the events whose probability are already known by us.== 
4. Apply the additive and multiplicative laws of probability to the compositions obtained in step 3 to find $P(A)$.
