This method is used to find the [[probability]] of a [[event]]. The steps are as follow. 
# steps
1. Define the experiment and clearly determine how to describe one simple event.
2. List the simple events associated with the experiment and test each to make certain that it cannot be decomposed. This defines the sample space $S$. 
3. Assign reasonable probabilities to the sample points in $S$, making certain that $P(E_i) ≥ 0$ and $\sum P(E_i) = 1$. 
4. Define the event of interest, $A$, as a specific collection of sample points. (A sample point is in $A$ if A occurs when the sample point occurs. Test all sample points in $S$ to identify those in $A$.)
5. Find $P(A)$ by summing the probabilities of the sample points in $A$.
