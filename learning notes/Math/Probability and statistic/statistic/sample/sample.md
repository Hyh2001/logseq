Sample is a subset selected from a [[population]]. Its size is referred as [[sample size]], and the data that collected from some of its features is called the [[sample data]]. The features that measured to provide [[sample data]] is called [[variable]] . Because the process of drawing a sample from a [[population]] is random, therefore there always exists a situation that sample cannot fully represent the [[population]]. Thus we denote the error between sample and population as [[sampling error]]. 
## types of samples
There are several types of samples, one is [[random sample]].
