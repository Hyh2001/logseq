# definition
The variance of a sample of measurements  $y_1,y_2,y_3,...,y_n$ is the sum of the square of the differences between the measurements and their [[mean]], divided by $n-1$. Symbolically,
$s^{2} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2$
#### sum of squared deviation(SSD)
$\sum_{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2$
[[population]] variance is $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{n}(y_i-\mu)^2$

## understanding of variance


## variance of of random variable
The variance of a random variable can be calculated using the equation $V[X] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$ $E[X]$ is the [[expected value]] of the random variable $X$ 

### variance of a function of a random variable
$V[ax +b] = a^2V[x]$
