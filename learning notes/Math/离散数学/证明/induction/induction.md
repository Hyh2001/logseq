# Ordinary induction
## the induction principle 
Let $P$ be a predicate on nonnegative integers. If
1. $P(0)$ is true
2. $P(n)$ IMPLIES $P(n+1)$ for all nongenerative integers $n$
then,
$P(m)$ is true for all nonnegative integers $m$ 
## induction rule
$\frac{P(0), \forall n \in \mathbb{N}.P(n) \quad IMPLIES \quad P(n+1)}{\forall m \in \mathbb{N}.P(m)}$
## induction proof template
1. State that the proof uses induction
2. Define an appropriate predicate $P(n)$, $P(n)$ is *induction hypothesis*
3. Prove that $P(0)$ is true
4. Prove that $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for every nonnegative integer $n$
5. Invoke induction 

# strong induction
## aim
Proving that a predicate is true for all nonnegative integers. 
## principles
Let $P$ be a predicate on nonnegative integers. If 
1. $P(0)$ is true
2. For all $n$ in $\mathbb{N}, P(0),P(1),...P(n)$  together imply $P(n+1)$
then $P(m)$ is true for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$
==You can assume a stronger set(from $P(0)$ to $P(n)$ are all true) of hypotheses==
## Rule
$\frac{P(0), [\forall k \leq n \in \mathbb{N}. P(k)] \quad IMPLIES \quad P(n+1)}{\forall m \in \mathbb{N}.P(m)}$

==Any proof by strong induction can be reformatted into a proof using ordinary induction. As the same, any well ordering proof can automatically be reformatted into an induction form. They are simply different formats for presenting the same mathematical reasoning.==

## invariant
Hold for initial state and preserved for every single step but does not hold at special states. This means that you can’t reach it.
