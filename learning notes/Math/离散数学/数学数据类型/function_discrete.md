# definition
A function assigns an element of one set, called the [[domain]], to an element of another set, called the [[codomain]]. 
$f: A \to B$
## finite domain
A function with a finite domain could be specified by a table that shows the value of the function at each element of the domain
## image
Applying $f$ to a set $S$ of arguments is referred to as “applying $f$ pointwise to $S$”, and the set $f(S)$ is referred to as the image of $S$ under $f$
## function composition
For functions $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$, the composition, $g \circ f$ , of $g$ with $f$ is defined to be the function from $A$ to $C$ defined by the rule:
$(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$
