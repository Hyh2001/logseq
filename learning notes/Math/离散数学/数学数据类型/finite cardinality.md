# definition
A finite set is one that has only a finite number of elements. This number of elements is the “size” or *cardinality* of the set. Notation is $|S|$

## properties proved
For finite sets $A,B$:
1. $A$ $surj$ $B$ $iff$ $|A| \geq |B|$  ($A$ $surj$ $B$ $iff$ there is a surjective function from $A$ to $B$)
prove:$\leq 1$ out and $\geq 1$ in, their amount are equal which means $|A| \geq |B|$
2. $A$ $inj$ $B$ $iff$ $|A| \leq |B|$ ($A$ $inj$ $B$ $iff$ there is an injective total relation from $A$ to $B$)
prove:$\geq 1$ out and $\leq 1$ in, their amount are equal which means $|A| \leq |B|$
3. $A$ $bij$ $B$ $iff$ $|A| = |B|$ ($A$ $bij$ $B$ $iff$ there is a bijection from $A$ to $B$)
prove::$= 1$ out and $= 1$ in, their amount are equal which means $|A| = |B|$

## numbers of subsets of a finite set
There are $2^n$ subsets of an $n$-element set.
