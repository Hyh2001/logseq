Integration is mainly used in some problems that need to find the area of a region bounded by a curve.(It is find the [[Riemann sum]] of infinite small areas) It can be used in real problems like [[area problem]], [[volume problem]], [[average value of a function]] distance problem. [[Integral]]s are the outcomes of integration. Integration is the inverse process of [[differential]](more details can be seen in [[differential and integration]]). With [[the fundamental theorem of calculus]], we can find the value of a [[definite integral]] by using its [[antiderivative]]. 
We can have several methods to find [[antiderivative]]s of many functions. They include:
1. [[substitution rule]]
2. [[integration by parts]] 
3. [[trigonometric integration]]
