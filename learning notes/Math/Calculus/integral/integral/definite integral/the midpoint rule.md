This method is used to find an approximation to an [[integral]]. ==The thought behind this method is to use finite intervals to approximate infinite intervals.== 
The definition of the method is as follow: 
$\int_a^b f(x)dx \simeq \sum_{i=1}^n f(\bar{x_i})\delta x = \delta x[f(\bar{x_1}) + ... + f(\bar{x_n})]$
Where $\delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$ and $\bar{x_i} = \frac{1}{2}(x_{i-1} + x_i) =$ midpoint of $[x_{i-1},x_i]$
