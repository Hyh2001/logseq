# The fundamental theorem of calculus, 1
If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then the function $g$ defined by
$g(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt$     $a \leq x \leq b$
Is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, and $g^{'}(x) =f (x)$
#### proof
If $x$ and $x+h$ are in $(a,b)$, then
$g(x+h) - g(x) = \int_a^{x+h}f(t)dt - \int_a^xf(t)dt = (\int_a^xf(t)dt + \int_x^{x+h}f(t)dt) - \int_a^xf(t)dt = \int_x^{x+h}f(t)dt$
assume $h \neq 0$, 
$\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h} = \frac{1}{h}\int_x^{x+h}f(t)dt$
by [[the extreme value theorem]], for $f$ continuous on $[x,x+h]$, there are always [[absolute maximum]] $f(u) = m$ and [[absolute minimum]] $f(v) = M$
For $f$, we have:
$f(u)h \leq \int_x^{x+h}f(t)dt \leq f(v)h$
we get:
$f(u) \leq \frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h} \leq f(v)$
Let $h \to 0$
we can get $\lim_{h \to 0} f(u) = f(x)$, $\lim_{h \to 0} f(v) = f(x)$
thus, 
$lim_{h \to 0}\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h} = g^{'}(x) =f(x)$

# The fundamental theorem of calculus, 2
If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then
$\int_a^bf(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)$
where $F$ is any [[antiderivative]] of $f$, that is, a function such that $F^{'} =f$
#### proof
let $g(x) = \int_a^x f(t)dt$, then we will have
$F(x) = g(x) + C$ for $a < x < b$
For $F$ and $g$ are continuous, the relation above is true for $x$ in $[a,b]$ 
Let $x = a$, then $g(a) = \int_a^af(t)dt = 0$ 
$F(b) - F(a) = g(b) - g(a) = g(b) = \int_a^bf(t)dt$
