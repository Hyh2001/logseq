1. If $f(x) \leq g(x)$ when$ $x$ is near $a$ (except possibly at $a$) and the limits of $f$ and $g$ both exist as $x$ approaches $a$, then
$lim_{x \to a}f(x) \leq lim_{x \to a}g(x)$
2. If $f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x)$ when $x$ is near $a$ (except possibly at $a$) and
$lim_{x \to a}f(x) = lim_{x \to a}h(x) = L$
then, $lim_{x \to a}g(x) = L$
