# intuitive definition
suppose $f(x)$ is defined when $x$ is near the number a. ($f$ is defined on some open interval that contains $a$, except possibly at $a$.)
we write $lim_{x \to a}f(x) = L$
# precise definition
Let $f$ be a function defined on some open interval that contains the number $a$, except possibly at $a$ itself. Then we say that the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$, and we write
$lim_{x \to a}f(x) = L$
if for every number $\epsilon > 0$ there is a number $\delta >0$ such that 
if $0 <|x - a |< \delta$  then $|f(x) - L|<\epsilon$
