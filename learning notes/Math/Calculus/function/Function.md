# definition 
A quantity that relates two quantities to each other. 
$x \in R^D$ to $f(x) \in E$
## in-depth understanding
$f$ is a [[mapping]] from $R^D$ to $R$ Which assigns every input $x$ exactly one function value $f(x)$.
## determination of whether it is a function
A curve in the $xy$-plane is the graph of a function of $x$ if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once

## real word understanding of a function
1. A move that measures a variable from a sample.
