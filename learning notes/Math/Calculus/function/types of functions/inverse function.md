# prerequisite
## one to one function
A function $f$ is called a one-to-one function if it never takes on the same value twice
$f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$  whenever $(x_1 \neq x_2)$
### horizontal test(test whether a function is a one to one function)
A function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects its graph more than once.

# definition 
Let $f$ be a one-to-one function with domain $A$ and range $B$. Then its inverse function $f^{-1}$ has domain $B$ and range $A$ and is defined by 
$f^{-1}(y) = x \iff f(x) =y$  for any $y$ in $B$.
## properties
1. $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for every $x$ in $A$ 
2. $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ for every $x$ in $B$
## find of inverse function
solve $x$ in terms of $y$
### graphically
The graph of $f^{-1}$ is obtained by reflecting the graph of $f$ about the line $y = x$.
