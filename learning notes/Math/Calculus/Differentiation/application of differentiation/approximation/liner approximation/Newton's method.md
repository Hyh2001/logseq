# definition
To find an approximate root to a given function
### steps
1. We guess an approximation called $x_1$
2. Find the tangent line of the curve at $x_1$ 
3. find the x-intersect of the tangent line 
4. Repeat the above steps using the intersect $x_2$
5. the answer iteratively will be $x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f^{'}(x_n)}$
6. the final answer is $lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = r$
### when the method failed?
$f^{'}(x_1)$ is close to 0 which makes $x_2$ to be a bad choice
#### solve
Chose a better $x_1$
