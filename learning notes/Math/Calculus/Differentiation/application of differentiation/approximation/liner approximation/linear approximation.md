# principle
Zooming in toward a point on the graph of a differentiable function, we noticed that the graph looks more and more like its tangent line
# method 
we use the tangent line at $(a,f(a))$ as an approximation to the curve $y = f(x)$when x is near $a$
## tangent line
$y \simeq f(a) + f^{'}(a)(x-a)$
also see [[derivative]]
### property
==This formula is true only when $x$ is near $a$  ==
