# definition
Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the following three hypotheses:
1. $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$
2. $f$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$
3. $f(a) = f(b)$
Then there is a number $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f^{'}(c) = 0$
### proof
#### Case 1. $f(x) = k$
Then $f^{'}(x) = 0$, so the number $c$ can be taken to be any number in $(a,b)$.
#### Case 2.$f(x) > f(a)$ for some $x$ in $(a,b)$
By extreme value theorem, we can get that there must a local maximum at $c$ in $(a,b)$ for $f(a) = f(b)$, and at the local maximum $f^{'}(c) = 0$
#### Case 3.$f(x) < f(a)$ for some $x$ in $(a,b)$
By extreme value theorem, we can get that there must a local minimum at $c$ in $(a,b)$ for $f(a) = f(b)$, and at the local maximum $f^{'}(c) = 0$
