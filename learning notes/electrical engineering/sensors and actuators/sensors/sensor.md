# definition 
A sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and send the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor.
## active sensors
require an external excitation signal or a power signal 
## passive sensors 
do not require any external power signal and directly generates output response

## electromechanical sensor
### [[piezo-resistive effect]]
use the change in electrical resistance of a material when stretched to measure the pressure/strain

### piezoelectric sensor
### electrostatic sensor

## measure of behaviors of sensors
### sensitivity
change in input required to generate a unit change in output

### measurement range
maximum and minimum value range over which a sensor works well. 

### calibration

### response
#### response time
The time for a sensor to respond from no load to a step change in load. Usually specified as time to rise to *90%* of final value
#### recover time
The time for a sensor to return to baseline value after the step removal of the measured variable. Usually specified as time to fall to *10%* of final value after step removal of measured variable. 

### stability
The degree to which sensor characteristics remain constant over time.

### repeatability
Ability of a sensor to repeat a measurement when put back in the same environment, or the response for different sensors.
