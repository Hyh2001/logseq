# definition
a change in the electrical resistivity of a semiconductor or metal when mechanical strain is applied
## piezoresistive coefficient
measure of change of electrical resistivity with respect to strain
$\rho_{\sigma} = \frac{\frac{\partial \rho}{\rho}}{\epsilon}$
$\partial \rho =$ change in resistivity
$\rho$ original resistivity
$\epsilon$ strain

## material has this property
### semiconductor
#### advantages
1. more sensitive
2. higher temperature applications
