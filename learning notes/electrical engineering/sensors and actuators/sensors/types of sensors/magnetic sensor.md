# principle
## electromagnetic induction effect
A process in which a conductor is put in a particular position and magnetic filed keeps varying or magnetic field is stationary and a conductor is moving. This produces a Voltage/Current across the electrical conductor. 
### direction determination

### induction voltages
$\epsilon = -N\frac{\partial \phi_B}{\partial t}$
## characteristics of the sensor
1. large current and small voltage
