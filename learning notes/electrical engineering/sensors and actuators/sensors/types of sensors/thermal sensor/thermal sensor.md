# types of thermal sensors
## contact
### thermistor
A type of resistor whose resistance is strongly dependent on temperature
#### negative temperature coefficient
Provides higher resistance at low temperatures
##### range 
-55 degree to 200 degree
#### positive temperature coefficient
Provides higher resistance at higher temperatures.
##### range
60 degree to 120 degree
#### advantages
1. large resistance change with temperature
2. rapid response time
3. good stability
4. high resistance eliminates difficulties caused by lead resistance
5. low cost and interchangeable. 
#### disadvantages
1. Non-linear
2. limited operating temperature range
3. may subject to inaccuracy due to overheating
4. current source required
### resistance temperature detector
#### structure
Consist of a film, or, for greater accuracy, a wire wrapped around a ceramic or glass core. Platinum makes up the most accurate RTDs while nickel and copper make RTDs that are lower cost.
#### range
-200 degree tp 600 degree for platinum
