  {"id":"antonPiezoelectretFoamBased2014","abstract":"The use of energy harvesting to provide power to low-power electronic devices has the potential to create autonomous, self-powered electronics. This article presents the investigation of a novel material for vibration-based energy harvesting. Piezoelectret foam, a lead-free, polymer-based electret material exhibiting piezoelectric-like properties, is investigated for low-power energy generation. An overview of the fabrication and operation of piezoelectret foams is first given. Mechanical testing is then performed, where anisotropy in the principal length directions is found along with Young’s moduli between 0.5 and 1 GPa and tensile strengths from 35 to 70 MPa. Dynamic electromechanical characterization is performed in order to measure the piezoelectric d33 coefficient of the foam over a wide frequency range. The d33 coefficient is found to be relatively constant at around 175 pC/N from 10 Hz to 1 kHz. Finally, the foam is evaluated as an energy harvesting material by first developing an electromechanical model to predict the voltage response during excitation, then performing dynamic experimentation to measure the voltage frequency response with comparisons to modeling predictions for a set of electrical loads, and finally conducting energy harvesting experimentation in which the foam is used to charge a capacitor. Harmonic excitation of a pre-tensioned 15.2 cm 3 15.2 cm sample at 60 Hz and displacement of 6 73 mm yields an average power of 6.0 mW delivered to a 1 mF storage capacitor. The capacitor is charged to 4.67 V in 30 min, proving the ability of piezoelectret foam to supply power to small electronic components.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Anton","given":"Sr"},{"family":"Farinholt","given":"Km"},{"family":"Erturk","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"antonPiezoelectretFoamBased2014","container-title":"Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures","container-title-short":"Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures","DOI":"10.1177/1045389X14541501","ISSN":"1045-389X, 1530-8138","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9]]},"language":"en","page":"1681-1692","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Piezoelectret foam–based vibration energy harvesting","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1045389X14541501","volume":"25"},

Most robots and autonomous vehicles depend on noisy data from sensors such as cameras or laser rangefinders to navigate in a three-dimensional world. This book presents common sensor models and practical advice on how to carry out state estimation for rotations and other state variables. It covers both classical state estimation methods such as the Kalman filter, as well as important modern topics such as batch estimation, the Bayes filter, sigmapoint and particle filters, robust estimation for outlier rejection, and continuous-time trajectory estimation and its connection to Gaussian-process regression. The methods are demonstrated in the context of important applications such as point-cloud alignment, pose-graph relaxation, bundle adjustment, and simultaneous localization and mapping.

  {"id":"chenCombinedFaultLocation2018","abstract":"Accurate and timely diagnosis of transmission line faults is key for reliable operations of power systems. Existing fault-diagnosis methods rely on expert knowledge or extensive feature extraction, which is also highly dependent on expert knowledge. Additionally, most methods for fault diagnosis of transmission lines require multiple separate subalgorithms for fault classiﬁcation and location performing each function independently and sequentially. In this research, an integrated framework combining fault classiﬁcation and location is proposed by applying an innovative machine-learning algorithm: the summation-wavelet extreme learning machine (SW-ELM) that integrates feature extraction in the learning process. As a further contribution, an extension of the SW-ELM, i.e., the summation-Gaussian extreme learning machine (SG-ELM), is proposed and successfully applied to transmission line fault diagnosis. SG-ELM is fully self-learning and does not require ad-hoc feature extraction, making it deployable with minimum expert subjectivity. The developed framework is applied to three transmission-line topologies without any prior parameter tuning or ad-hoc feature extraction. Evaluations on a simulated dataset show that the proposed method can diagnose faults within a single cycle, remain immune to fault resistance and inception angle variation, and deliver high accuracy for both tasks of fault diagnosis: fault type classiﬁcation and fault location estimation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yann Qi"},{"family":"Fink","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Sansavini","given":"Giovanni"}],"citation-key":"chenCombinedFaultLocation2018","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"daiModelSignalKnowledge2013","abstract":"This review paper is to give a full picture of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in complex systems from the perspective of data processing. As a matter of fact, an FDD system is a data-processing system on the basis of information redundancy, in which the data and human’s understanding of the data are two fundamental elements. Human’s understanding may be an explicit input–output model representing the relationship among the system’s variables. It may also be represented as knowledge implicitly (e.g., the connection weights of a neural network). Therefore, FDD is done through some kind of modeling, signal processing, and intelligence computation. In this paper, a variety of FDD techniques are reviewed within the uniﬁed data-processing framework to give a full picture of FDD and achieve a new level of understanding. According to the types of data and how the data are processed, the FDD methods are classiﬁed into three categories: model-based online data-driven methods, signal-based methods, and knowledge-based history data-driven methods. An outlook to the possible evolution of FDD in industrial automation, including the hybrid FDD and the emerging networked FDD, are also presented to reveal the future development direction in this ﬁeld.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Dai","given":"Xuewu"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Zhiwei"}],"citation-key":"daiModelSignalKnowledge2013","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"erenGenericIntelligentBearing2019","abstract":"Timely and accurate bearing fault detection and diagnosis is important for reliable and safe operation of industrial systems. In this study, performance of a generic real-time induction bearing fault diagnosis system employing compact adaptive 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is extensively studied. In the literature, although many studies have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting bearing faults, their results have generally been limited to relatively small train/test data sets. As opposed to conventional intelligent fault diagnosis systems that usually encapsulate feature extraction, feature selection and classification as distinct blocks, the proposed system takes directly raw time-series sensor data as input and it can efficiently learn optimal features with the proper training. The main advantages of the 1D CNN based approach are 1) its compact architecture configuration (rather than the complex deep architectures) which performs only 1D convolutions making it suitable for real-time fault detection and monitoring, 2) its cost effective and practical real-time hardware implementation, 3) its ability to work without any pre-determined transformation (such as FFT or DWT), hand-crafted feature extraction and feature selection, and 4) its capability to provide efficient training of the classifier with limited size of training data set and limited number of BP iterations. Effectiveness and feasibility of the 1D CNN based fault diagnosis method is validated by applying it to two commonly used benchmark real vibration data sets and comparing the results with the other competing intelligent fault diagnosis methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Eren","given":"Levent"},{"family":"Ince","given":"Turker"},{"family":"Kiranyaz","given":"Serkan"}],"citation-key":"erenGenericIntelligentBearing2019","container-title":"Journal of Signal Processing Systems","container-title-short":"J Sign Process Syst","DOI":"10.1007/s11265-018-1378-3","ISSN":"1939-8018, 1939-8115","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2]]},"language":"en","page":"179-189","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Generic Intelligent Bearing Fault Diagnosis System Using Compact Adaptive 1D CNN Classifier","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11265-018-1378-3","volume":"91"},

It is important to identify and diagnose the failure behavior of bearings for the reliable operation of equipment. In this paper, a low-cost non-contact vibration sensor has been developed for detecting the faults in bearings. The supervised learning method, support vector machine (SVM), has been employed as a tool to validate the effectiveness of the developed sensor. Experimental vibration data collected for different bearing defects under various loading and running conditions have been analyzed to develop a system for diagnosing the faults for machine health monitoring. Fault diagnosis has been accomplished using discrete wavelet transform for denoising the signal. Mahalanobis distance criteria has been employed for selecting the strongest feature on the extracted relevant features. Finally, these selected features have been passed to the SVM classiﬁer for identifying and classifying the various bearing defects. The results reveal that the vibration signatures obtained from developed non-contact sensor compare well with the accelerometer data obtained under the same conditions. A developed sensor is a promising tool for detecting the bearing damage and identifying its class. SVM results have established the effectiveness of the developed noncontact sensor as a vibration measuring instrument which makes the developed sensor a cost-effective tool for the condition monitoring of rotating machines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Goyal","given":"Deepam"},{"family":"Choudhary","given":"Anurag"},{"family":"Pabla","given":"B.

A PM array was realized by pressing two sides of each arch membrane into the radial grooves of a rotor disk, and a PM-TENG was formed together with a stator disk with interdigital electrodes pasted on the surface. Variations in output voltage and current with load resistance were tested, and the effects of design parameters on the output characteristics were discussed. It is demonstrated that the proposed PM-TENG has self-powered characteristics by charging the load capacitor and effectively driving micropowered electronic devices. Two test rigs were constructed for fault diagnosis tests in the rotating machinery. Fault characteristic frequencies were identiﬁed using the output current model of the PM-TENG. Fast Fourier transform and deep learning models were used to classify only bearing and gear-bearing hybrid faults, respectively. The results showed that the PM-TENG output current can be used to diagnose typical faults in rotating machinery; the classiﬁcation accuracy exceeded 92%, which is only slightly lower than that based on the vibration signal. The proposed PM-TENG has application potential for rotating machinery fault diagnosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Qinkai"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Ziyuan"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Fulei"}],"citation-key":"hanPrebentMembraneBasedDiskType2022","container-title":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","container-title-short":"IEEE/ASME Trans.

A TENG comes with variety of structures and mechanisms that make it suitable for wide range of applications and working conditions. Since mechanical vibrations are abundant source of energy in the surrounding environment, the development of a TENG for vibration energy harvesting and vibration measurements has attracted a huge attention and great research interest through the past two decades. Due to the high output voltage and high-power density of a TENG, it can be used as a sustainable power supply for small electronics, smart devices, and wireless sensors. In addition, it can work as a vibration sensor with high sensitivity. This article reviews the recent progress in the development of a TENG for vibration energy harvesting and vibration measurements. Systems of only a TENG or a hybrid TENG with other transduction technologies, such as piezoelectric and electromagnetic, can be utilized for vibrations scavenging. Vibration measurement can be done by measuring either vibration displacement or vibration acceleration. Each can provide full information about the vibration amplitude and frequency. Some TENG vibration-sensing architectures may also be used for energy harvesting due to their large output power. Numerous applications can rely on TENG vibration sensors such as machine condition monitoring, structure health monitoring, and the Internet of things (IoT).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Haroun","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Tarek","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Mosleh","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Ismail","given":"Farouk"}],"citation-key":"harounRecentProgressTriboelectric2022","container-title":"Nanomaterials","container-title-short":"Nanomaterials","DOI":"10.3390/nano12172960","ISSN":"2079-4991","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,26]]},"language":"en","page":"2960","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recent Progress on Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Vibration Energy Harvesting and Vibration Sensing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/17/2960","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"heTriboelectricVibrationSensor2019","abstract":"Human-machine interfaces enable the exchange of information between people and machines, which plays a crucial role in artiﬁcial intelligence. In this ﬁeld, sensors based on magnetism, electricity, mechanics, and optics are used to construct interactive interfaces and have an important role in sensing human behavior. Here, we present a vibration sensor based human-machine interface (HMI) with an unlimited sensing area on a ubiquitous surface by detecting and positioning an external vibration source. To accurately perceive an external minute vibration, we proposed triboelectric vibration sensors (TVS) designed by mimicking the ampulla in the lateral line of a ﬁsh. Imitating the cilia wrapped in the ampulla structure, the tribo-pair of TVS were designed as nanowire arrays and hemispherical pore structures. It achieved a high force sensitivity of 0.97 V/N when the force is less than 1 N and a broad frequency range from 1 to 3 kHz. Given the excellent performance of the TVS, an in-plane vibration source detection and location system was developed, which utilizes the time diﬀerence in the arrival estimation method based on correlation analysis. As a demonstration, a TVS-based intelligent virtual digital keyboard was developed by sensing and locating the position of the keystroke for interactive input and importer authentication according to the bionic features. Furthermore, a customized multifunctional desktop interactive system was established by functionalizing an ordinary table for convenient electrical appliance control. In this way, ordinary surfaces such as tables, walls, and doors have the potential to be converted into multifunctional interactive interfaces. The proposed TVS-based HMI in this work can be immediately and extensively adopted in a variety of applications for portable computer peripherals, cyber security, and intelligent home systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yufen"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Zhiping"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Chenchen"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Wenjing"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Zhihao"},{"family":"Meng","given":"Keyu"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Endong"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jin"}],"citation-key":"heTriboelectricVibrationSensor2019","container-title":"Nano Energy","container-title-short":"Nano Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.03.005","ISSN":"22112855","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5]]},"language":"en","page":"689-696","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Triboelectric vibration sensor for a human-machine interface built on ubiquitous surfaces","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211285519301934","volume":"59"},

Used as physical models, biorobots contribute to hypothesis testing in fields such as hydrodynamics, biomechanics, neuroscience, and prosthetics.

Here, we report a powder-based triboelectric nanogenerator (P-TENG) using polytetraﬂuoroethylene powder as a freestanding triboelectric layer. By employing powder, which has ﬂuid-like characteristics, the device is able to harvest random vibrational energy from all directions and can be fabricated regardless of the size or shape of its container. Notably, this device shows excellent durability against mechanical friction and immunity against humidity. It is also capable of powering 240 green LEDs and charging a commercial energy-harvesting battery.

  {"id":"koditschekRobotPlanningControl","abstract":"There mingle in the contemporary field of robotics a great many disparate currents of thought from a large variety of disciplines. Nevertheless, a largely unspoken understanding seems to prevail in the field to the effect that certain topics are conceptually distinct. In general, methods of task planning are held to be unrelated to methods of control. The former belong to the realm of geometry and logic whereas the latter inhabit the earthier domain of engineering analysis; geometry is usually associated with off-line computation whereas everyone knows that control must be accomplished in real-time; the one is a “high level” activity whereas the other is at a “low level”. This article concerns one circle of ideas that, in contrast, intrinsically binds action and intention together in the description of the robot’s task. From the perspective of task planning, this point of view seeks to represent abstract goals via a geometric formalism which is guaranteed to furnish a correct control law as well. From the perspective of control theory, the methodology substitutes reference dynamical systems for reference trajectories. From the point of view of computation, less is required off-line, while more is demanded of the real-time controller. From the historical perspective, these techniques represent the effort of engineers to avail themselves of natural physical phenomena in the synthesis of unnatural machines.","author":[{"family":"Koditschek","given":"Daniel E"}],"citation-key":"koditschekRobotPlanningControl","language":"en","page":"20","source":"Zotero","title":"Robot Planning and Control Via Potential Functions","type":"article-journal"},

In the proposed method, vibration signal data are obtained from the induction motor experimental environment, and these values are input into the CNN. Then, the CNN performs fault diagnosis. In this study, fault diagnosis of an induction motor is performed in three states, namely, normal, rotor fault, and bearing fault. In addition, a GUI (graphical user interface) for the proposed fault diagnosis system is presented. The experimental results conﬁrm that the proposed method is suitable for diagnosing rotor and bearing faults of induction motors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Jong-Hyun"},{"family":"Pack","given":"Jae-Hyung"},{"family":"Lee","given":"In-Soo"}],"citation-key":"leeFaultDiagnosisInduction2019","container-title":"Applied Sciences","container-title-short":"Applied Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/app9152950","ISSN":"2076-3417","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,24]]},"language":"en","page":"2950","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motor Using Convolutional Neural Network","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/15/2950","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"leiApplicationsMachineLearning2020","abstract":"Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) refers to applications of machine learning theories to machine fault diagnosis. This is a promising way to release the contribution from human labor and automatically recognize the health states of machines, thus it has attracted much attention in the last two or three decades. Although IFD has achieved a considerable number of successes, a review still leaves a blank space to systematically cover the development of IFD from the cradle to the bloom, and rarely provides potential guidelines for the future development. To bridge the gap, this article presents a review and roadmap to systematically cover the development of IFD following the progress of machine learning theories and offer a future perspective. In the past, traditional machine learning theories began to weak the contribution of human labor and brought the era of artiﬁcial intelligence to machine fault diagnosis. Over the recent years, the advent of deep learning theories has reformed IFD in further releasing the artiﬁcial assistance since the 2010s, which encourages to construct an end-to-end diagnosis procedure. It means to directly bridge the relationship between the increasingly-grown monitoring data and the health states of machines. In the future, transfer learning theories attempt to use the diagnosis knowledge from one or multiple diagnosis tasks to other related ones, which prospectively overcomes the obstacles in applications of IFD to engineering scenarios. Finally, the roadmap of IFD is pictured to show potential research trends when combined with the challenges in this ﬁeld.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lei","given":"Yaguo"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xinwei"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Naipeng"},{"family":"Nandi","given":"Asoke K."}],"citation-key":"leiApplicationsMachineLearning2020","container-title":"Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","container-title-short":"Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","DOI":"10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.106587","ISSN":"08883270","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4]]},"language":"en","page":"106587","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Applications of machine learning to machine fault diagnosis: A review and roadmap","title-short":"Applications of machine learning to machine fault diagnosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0888327019308088","volume":"138"},
  {"id":"leiIntelligentFaultDiagnosis2016","abstract":"Intelligent fault diagnosis is a promising tool to deal with mechanical big data due to its ability in rapidly and efﬁciently processing collected signals and providing accurate diagnosis results. In traditional intelligent diagnosis methods, however, the features are manually extracted depending on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise. Such processes take advantage of human ingenuity but are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Inspired by the idea of unsupervised feature learning that uses artiﬁcial intelligence techniques to learn features from raw data, a two-stage learning method is proposed for intelligent diagnosis of machines. In the ﬁrst learning stage of the method, sparse ﬁltering, an unsupervised two-layer neural network, is used to directly learn features from mechanical vibration signals. In the second stage, softmax regression is employed to classify the health conditions based on the learned features. The proposed method is validated by a motor bearing dataset and a locomotive bearing dataset, respectively. The results show that the proposed method obtains fairly high diagnosis accuracies and is superior to the existing methods for the motor bearing dataset. Because of learning features adaptively, the proposed method reduces the need of human labor and makes intelligent fault diagnosis handle big data more easily.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lei","given":"Yaguo"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Saibo"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Steven X."}],"citation-key":"leiIntelligentFaultDiagnosis2016","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

However, due to sensor malfunctions, the training and testing data can be collected at different places of machines, resulting in the feature space with signiﬁcant distribution discrepancy. This challenging issue has received less attention in the current literature, and the existing approaches generally fail in such scenarios. This article proposes a domain adaptation method for machinery fault diagnostics based on deep learning. Adversarial training is introduced for marginal domain fusion, and unsupervised parallel data are explored to achieve conditional distribution alignments with respect to different machine health conditions. Experiments on two rotating machinery datasets are carried out for validations. The results suggest the proposed method is promising to address the fault diagnostic tasks with data from different places of machines, further enhancing applicability of datadriven methods in real industries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Nan-Xi"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Qian"}],"citation-key":"liDeepLearningBasedMachinery2020","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"liVibrationalTriboelectricNanogeneratorBased2020","abstract":"Physical parameter sensing largely beneﬁts the lifetime and operational costs of machines and has been widely used for machine fault detection. Herein, in this article, we developed a multinode sensor network, which is fully self-powered by harvesting mechanical vibration energy, to establish a machine fault detection system. A multilayered vibrational triboelectric nanogenerator (V-TENG) was designed to scavenge energy from working machines. Triggered by a vibration motion with the frequency of 8 Hz, the V-TENG can generate an output with power density of 3.33 mW/m3. With a power management module, the microcontrol unit integrated with sensors and a wireless transmitter can be continuously powered by the V-TENG to construct a self-powered vibration sensor node (SVSN). A supporting vector machine algorithm-based machine fault detection system was then established through a three-SVSN network by acquiring acceleration and temperature data from the working machine. Based on the system, different working conditions of the machine were recognized with an accuracy of 83.6%. The TENG-based SVSN for machine fault detection has demonstrated wide prospects in production monitoring, intelligent manufacturing, and smart factory. Moreover, the proposed self-powered sensor network has great potential and wide application in the era of distributed Internet of Things, artiﬁcial intelligence, and big data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Wenjian"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yaoyao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuwei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Guoxu"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Junqing"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaohan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chi"}],"citation-key":"liVibrationalTriboelectricNanogeneratorBased2020","container-title":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","container-title-short":"IEEE/ASME Trans.

  {"id":"ouyangCopperParticlesPTFETube2022","abstract":"Developing sustainable energy is essential to achieve carbon neutrality. The emergence of triboelectric nano­ generators (TENGs) makes it possible to efficiently harvest the abundant wave energy in nature for their excellent operational stability and electrical performance at low frequencies. Here, a simplified copper particles-PTFE tube structured TENG (CP-TENG) was fabricated by encasing copper particles into a polytetrafluoroethylene tube and the small copper particles move with nearly fluid-like characteristics, expanding the contact area to ensure high charge density. A single CP-TENG includes two parallel-connected TENG units and can reach a maximum current density of 41.4 mA m− 3 at a frequency of 1 Hz. Meanwhile, several CP-TENG units can be flexibly assembled into various arrays to accomplish output increase. A sealed CP-TENG power box demonstrates an impressive capa­ bility to collect wave energy, lighting up at most 210 LEDs. The CP-TENG-based energy network may present a new technical approach for blue energy harvesting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Ouyang","given":"Ri"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Haotian"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zijun"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Hao"}],"citation-key":"ouyangCopperParticlesPTFETube2022","container-title":"Nano Energy","container-title-short":"Nano Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107749","ISSN":"22112855","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11]]},"language":"en","page":"107749","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Copper particles-PTFE tube based triboelectric nanogenerator for wave energy harvesting","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211285522008278","volume":"102"},

  {"id":"saqibParticleTriboelectricNanogenerator2022","abstract":"Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been rapidly studied for electromechanical energy scavenging and self-powered sensing. However, the limited research efforts have been devoted to utilizing tiny and irregular motions like from a human body and nature. Moreover, TENGs with multi-directional energy harnessing are rarely addressed so far. For the first time, this paper proposes a novel TENG by placing cellulose-based particles inside a rapidly degradable gelatin capsule to harvest electrical energy from all directional moving without conventional contact/separation requirements. The tiny cellulose particles (~6 µm) can generate triboelectric energy from low-frequency irregular motions, hence it is demonstrated as particle triboelectric nanogenerator (PTENG). The proposed P-TENG device generates voltage from 15 to 85 V, current from 409 to 1326 nA, and power from 5.488 to 70 μW, when the device units increase from 1 to 16. Apart from these, the P-TENG presents maximum energy conversion efficiency up to 74.35% during vertical motion. Furthermore, it can produce energy in versatile scenarios from the various human body motions and other environmental usual movements. Hence, the proposed device can pave a new sight for low-level triboelectricity for self-powered electronic systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Saqib","given":"Qazi Muhammad"},{"family":"Shaukat","given":"Rayyan Ali"},{"family":"Chougale","given":"Mahesh Y."},{"family":"Khan","given":"Muhammad Umair"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jungmin"},{"family":"Bae","given":"Jinho"}],"citation-key":"saqibParticleTriboelectricNanogenerator2022","container-title":"Nano Energy","container-title-short":"Nano Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107475","ISSN":"22112855","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9]]},"language":"en","page":"107475","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Particle triboelectric nanogenerator (P-TENG)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211285522005535","volume":"100"},

  {"id":"shardtNewSoftSensorBasedProcess2015","abstract":"The development of advanced techniques for process monitoring and fault diagnosis using both model-based and data-driven approaches has led to many practical applications. One issue that has not been considered in such applications is the ability to deal with key performance indicators (KPIs) that are only sporadically measured and with signiﬁcant time delay. Therefore, in this paper, the data-driven design of diagnosticobserver-based process monitoring schemes is extended to include the ability to detect changes given infrequently measured KPIs. The extended diagnostic observer is shown to be stable and hence able to converge to the true value. The proposed method is tested using both Monte Carlo simulations and the Tennessee-Eastman problem. It is shown that although time delay and sampling time increase the detection delay, the overall effect can be mitigated by using a soft sensor. Furthermore, it is shown that the results are not strongly dependent on the sampling time, but do depend on the time delay. Therefore, the proposed soft-sensor-based monitoring scheme can efﬁciently detect faults even in the absence of direct process information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Shardt","given":"Yuri A.

  {"id":"sharmaReviewGearFault2016","abstract":"Plentiful work has been done for condition monitoring (CI) and fault diagnosis of fixed-axis gearboxes. However, still it is found that articles citing condition indicators for fault diagnosis of gearboxes are less in quantity, in academic journals, conference proceedings and technical reports. The specialty of condition indicators is to provide accurate information regarding the condition of various components at different levels of damage (initial, heavy or growing). Here, these indicators are addressed domain-wise and their characteristics are stated. The objective of this paper is to review and encapsulate this literature to provide a wide and good reference for researchers to be utilized.

  {"id":"sizovApplicationPiezoelectricSensors2008","abstract":"In this paper, application of a piezoelectric vibration sensor to induction motor fault diagnostics is investigated. More specifically, a piezoelectric sensor is used to diagnose broken bar faults in squirrel-cage induction machines. The piezoelectric vibration sensor described in this paper offers a number of advantages when compared to other conventional vibration monitoring devices, such as accelerometers, velomitors, proximity probes, etc. These advantages can be summarized as follows: low cost, ease of implementation, and relatively high bandwidth. Use of a vibration signal as a medium for rotor fault diagnostics may result in a simplification of the diagnosis procedure, since both the fault index and the slip (speed) can be estimated from one signal. It is well known that rotor faults result in torque and possible consequent speed oscillations at twice the slip frequency, 2sf. These torque and speed oscillations/pulsations, in turn, produce detectable vibrations that can be utilized for purposes of rotor fault diagnostics. Moreover, radial forces produced as a result of such faults may result in increased vibration amplitude at the same, 2sf, frequency, which can further amplify the fault index, and hence make the proposed technique more reliable. Experimental results on broken bar diagnostics are presented here to demonstrate the validity and efficacy of this approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Sizov","given":"Gennadi Y."},{"family":"Yeh","given":"Chia-Chou"},{"family":"Demerdash","given":"Nabeel A.

Robots can facilitate response planning, maintaining situational awareness, removing responders from dangerous situations and allowing for immediate site feedback prior to human responder entry. This paper presents eight robotic tasks informed by a cognitive task analysis and an information ﬂow analysis. These analyses were conducted in order to inform the design of a system of multiple robots and the associated human–robotic interfaces required to support the CBRNE response command hierarchy. The cognitive task analysis was conducted over 3 years, and incorporated direct CBRNE response personnel feedback and CBRNE incident exercise observations. This paper presents the identiﬁed tasks and how robots can augment the existing human-based CBRNE incident response by improving the provided information and the speed at which information can be obtained, and reduce responders’ physical workload. It is clear from our analyses that poorly designed robots and task capabilities will be highly disruptive to the human-centric CBRNE response activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Tesch","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Lipkin","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Isaac"},{"family":"Hatton","given":"Ross"},{"family":"Peck","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Rembisz","given":"Justine"},{"family":"Choset","given":"Howie"}],"citation-key":"teschParameterizedScriptedGaits2009","container-title":"Advanced Robotics","container-title-short":"Advanced Robotics","DOI":"10.1163/156855309X452566","ISSN":"0169-1864, 1568-5535","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1131-1158","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Parameterized and Scripted Gaits for Modular Snake Robots","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1163/156855309X452566","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"wenNewConvolutionalNeural2018","abstract":"Fault diagnosis is vital in manufacturing system, since early detections on the emerging problem can save invaluable time and cost. With the development of smart manufacturing, the data-driven fault diagnosis becomes a hot topic. However, the traditional data-driven fault diagnosis methods rely on the features extracted by experts. The feature extraction process is an exhausted work and greatly impacts the ﬁnal result. Deep learning (DL) provides an effective way to extract the features of raw data automatically. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an effective DL method. In this study, a new CNN based on LeNet-5 is proposed for fault diagnosis. Through a conversion method converting signals into two-dimensional (2-D) images, the proposed method can extract the features of the converted 2-D images and eliminate the effect of handcrafted features.

  {"id":"wuResearchPotentialSpherical2020","abstract":"The traditional downhole drilling vibration measurement methods which use cable or battery as power supplies increase the drilling costs and reduce the drilling eﬃciency. This paper proposes a spherical triboelectric nanogenerator, which shows the potential to collect the downhole vibration energy and measure the vibration frequency in a self-powered model. The power generation tests show that the output signal amplitude of the spherical triboelectric nanogenerator increases as the vibration frequency increases, and it can reach a maximum output voltage of 70 V, a maximum current of 3.3 × 10−5 A, and a maximum power of 10.9 × 10−9 W at 8 Hz when a 10-ohm resistor is connected. Therefore, if the power generation is stored for a certain period of time when numbers of the spherical triboelectric nanogenerators are connected in parallel, it may provide intermittent power for the low-power downhole measurement instruments. In addition, the sensing tests show that the measurement range is 0 to 8 Hz, the test error is less than 2%, the applicable working environment temperature is below 100 degrees Celsius, and the installation distance between the spherical triboelectric nanogenerator and the vibration source should be less than the critical value of 150 cm because the output signal amplitude is inversely proportional to the distance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Chuan"},{"family":"Huang","given":"He"},{"family":"Li","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Chenxing"}],"citation-key":"wuResearchPotentialSpherical2020","container-title":"Sensors","container-title-short":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s20041063","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,15]]},"language":"en","page":"1063","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Research on the Potential of Spherical Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Collecting Vibration Energy and Measuring Vibration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/4/1063","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"xiaHoneycomblikeThreeElectrodes2015","abstract":"A novel honeycomb-like triboelectric generator (HTEG) based on three electrodes has been designed for harvesting mechanical energy in full space. It has symmetric and periodic arrangement of the three electrodes in plane or on the inner surface of ball, which can harvest sliding energy along arbitrary direction without off state because each electrode is always surrounded by the electrodes different from itself. Meanwhile, the device can effectively scavenge ambient vibration energy as an independent generator in full space by working at both contact-separation mode and sliding mode without contacting with the ground. The maximum output current density, voltage and power density can reach 16.4 mA/m2, 413 V, and 2.1 W/m2, respectively, by working in plane sliding mode, and the maximum output current to be 0.55 μA by working in sliding mode on an inner surface of a spherical shell. The HTEG can charge a 100 μF commercial capacitor to 2.1 V in 80 s. The football-like HTEG is used as a vibration alertor, which could be applied in vibration monitor or geologic hazard alertor for bridges and buildings. The idea of multi-electrode in HTEGs would be an effective strategy to achieve multi-function in scavenging energy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Xia","given":"Xiaona"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Guanlin"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Hengyu"},{"family":"Leng","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Chenguo"},{"family":"Xi","given":"Yi"}],"citation-key":"xiaHoneycomblikeThreeElectrodes2015","container-title":"Nano Energy","container-title-short":"Nano Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.05.033","ISSN":"22112855","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7]]},"language":"en","page":"766-775","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Honeycomb-like three electrodes based triboelectric generator for harvesting energy in full space and as a self-powered vibration alertor","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211285515002499","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"xieTriboelectricSensorPlanetary2022","abstract":"The planetary gear transmission system is characterized by a complex structure and is often exposed to harsh working conditions, resulting in high failure damage rate. The self-powered sensing system based on the triboelectric nanogenerator provides an ideal scheme for online monitoring of the planetary gear operating condition. In this paper, a triboelectric planetary gear sensor (TPGS) is proposed for real-time monitoring of the speed and gear faults of the planetary reducer. The sensor is integrated at the tooth crest and root meshing gap of the planetary gear and the ring gear, which ensures the integrity of the gear structure and function. The results of the sensing experiment show that TPGS can be used to detect the speed of the planetary reducer in the range of 10–1000 rpm. Moreover, the speed detection error rate is less than 0.4%. To identify the gear faults, the stacked autoencoder (SAE) is used to enhance the data collected by TPGS, combined with convolutional neural network (CNN). The results show that the classification accuracy reached 100%.

Herein, a triboelectric−electromagnetic hybridized nanogenerator (TEHG) for low-frequency random microvibrational energy harvesting in all directions and a wide working bandwidth is fabricated. The output peak power of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) up to 3.65 mW is realized (θ = 0.4 rad, f = 1 Hz). In addition, a real self-powered seawater splitting system and electrochemical cathodic protection system are fabricated, directly converting blue energy to hydrogen energy, and the ships can achieve selfprotection against corrosion. Furthermore, relying on the linear relationship between the number of peaks and the amplitude of vibration, a highly sensitive self-powered vibration amplitude sensor system based on LabVIEW software is achieved, which can be used as an amplitude detection of bridges and earthquake monitoring, etc. This work is an important development for harvesting low-frequency random multiple direction microvibrational energy over a wide working bandwidth and the bright future of blue energy.

Many conventional data-driven fault diagnosis methods ignore the fault tendency of abnormal samples, and they need a complete retraining process to include the newly collected abnormal samples or fault classes. In this article, a broad convolutional neural network (BCNN) is designed with incremental learning capability for solving the aforementioned issues. The proposed method combines several consecutive samples as a data matrix, and it then extracts both fault tendency and nonlinear structure from the obtained data matrix by using convolutional operation. After that, the weights in fully connected layers can be trained based on the obtained features and their corresponding fault labels. Because of the architecture of this network, the diagnosis performance of the BCNN model can be improved by adding newly generated additional features. Finally, the incremental learning capability of the proposed method is also designed, so that the BCNN model can update itself to include new coming abnormal samples and fault classes. The proposed method is applied both to a simulated process and a real industrial process. Experimental results illustrate that it can better capture the characteristics of the fault process, and effectively update diagnosis model to include new coming abnormal samples, and fault classes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Wanke"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Chunhui"}],"citation-key":"yuBroadConvolutionalNeural2020","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

However, because of the various composition and changing concentration, challenges still remain in low-cost and real-time sediment monitoring. Herein, we report a potential method to realize real-time monitoring of sediment particles param­ eters by introducing a particles-laden droplet-driven triboelectric nanogenerator (PLDD-TENG) combined with deep learning method. The mechanism of PLDD-TENG was proved to be induced by the liquid-PTFE electrifi­ cation and particles-electrode electrostatic induction. The output signals of PLDD-TENG were measured under different particles types and mass fractions. The results indicated that the output signals were sensitive to the particles type and mass fraction. A convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model was adopted to identify the particles parameters based on the output signals of PLDD-TENG and high identifying accuracy was achieved. Meanwhile, this model can identify particles types in the mixed solution. An intelligent system was finally developed to realize visualization of real-time monitoring for sediment particles. These findings are crucial in both fundamental understanding and application prospect of triboelectric effect in two-phase flow.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Zhibin"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yanjie"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Xiao"}],"citation-key":"yuMonitoringTriboelectricNanogenerator2022","container-title":"Nano Energy","container-title-short":"Nano Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106698","ISSN":"22112855","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2]]},"language":"en","page":"106698","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Monitoring on triboelectric nanogenerator and deep learning method","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211285521009484","volume":"92"},

  {"id":"zhangTwostageFaultDiagnosis2022","abstract":"Most intelligent fault diagnosis methods of rotating machinery generally consider that normal samples and fault samples as equally important for pattern recognition training. It ignores that the rotating machinery is in a normal state most of the time, and the collected normal samples are far more than the fault samples. Considering this situation, this paper proposes a two-stage intelligent fault diagnosis methodology for rotating machinery combing optimized support vector data description (SVDD) and optimized support vector machine (SVM). Specifically, SVDD is applied for fault detection, and SVM is applied for fault identification. The parameters of SVDD and SVM are optimized by the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA). Multiscale entropy (ME) is used for feature extraction, which is the input feature vector of SVDD and SVM. Under the framework of the proposed methodology, the strengths and weaknesses of 8 different entropy-based indicators in feature extraction are explored. The analysis results of three cases prove the availability and universality of the proposed methodology. According to the analysis results of three case analyses, the permutation entropy (PE)-based indicators are not promising for fault detection. Refined composite multiscale fuzzy entropy (RCMFE) is recommended for fault detection and fault identification to generalize the universality. Based on RCMFE, the fault detection accuracy in the three cases is more than 99%, and the fault identification accuracy is more than 94%. This methodology, therefore, provides a powerful tool for rotating machinery fault diagnosis, which is beneficial to practical application.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jianqun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Xianrong"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yuantao"}],"citation-key":"zhangTwostageFaultDiagnosis2022","container-title":"Measurement","container-title-short":"Measurement","DOI":"10.1016/j.measurement.2022.111651","ISSN":"02632241","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8]]},"language":"en","page":"111651","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A two-stage fault diagnosis methodology for rotating machinery combining optimized support vector data description and optimized support vector machine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0263224122008612","volume":"200"},

  {"id":"zhouReconfigurableFiberTriboelectric2022","abstract":"With the extensive applications of portable, wearable, and stretchable electronics, the ﬁber triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been developed particularly and rapidly. However, variable stiﬀness or even switchable stiﬀness for the ﬁber TENG is also urgently needed in some speciﬁc service conditions. Here, the functional, reconﬁgurable ﬁber TENG is presented for harvesting mechanical energy and self-powered sensors. It is mainly composed of soft tubes with ﬁlled low-melting-point alloy (LMPA), conductive wire, and electrically heated wire. Under an input frequency of 3 Hz, this ﬁber TENG produces a maximum peak power density of 348.5 μW/ m. Due to its excellent reconﬁgurable characteristics, it can be switched back and forth in many diﬀerent application situations. It can be intelligently used not only as a self-powered tactile and mechanical sensor but also as a self-powered splint for postdisaster relief work. Besides, the cracking detection of a gear and a lead screw is also realized using this ﬁber TENG. This work strongly promotes the application of variable stiﬀness LMPAs in the TENG, especially for the reconﬁgurable ﬁber TENG. It also promotes the potential self-powered applications of the TENG in the ﬁelds of sensors and detection, such as mechanical ﬂaw detection and self-powered tactile detection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Delei"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Lili"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Shichao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Han","given":"Zhiwu"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Luquan"}],"citation-key":"zhouReconfigurableFiberTriboelectric2022","container-title":"ACS Nano","container-title-short":"ACS Nano","DOI":"10.1021/acsnano.1c11569","ISSN":"1936-0851, 1936-086X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,24]]},"language":"en","page":"7721-7731","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reconfigurable Fiber Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Self-Powered Defect Detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.1c11569","volume":"16"},
