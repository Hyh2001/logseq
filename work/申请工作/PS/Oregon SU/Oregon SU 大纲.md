### Learning-Based Control
This course will facilitate my understanding on how to apply machine learning algorithms to robots. 

# working with Prof. Jonathan W. Hurst
### 1. Working on designing specific mechanical structures for legged robots and using reinforcement learning to control legged robots.
# working with Prof. YIGIT MENGUC
### 1. working on fabricating new soft material to build advanced soft robots
### 2. Working on precisely controlling dynamics of soft robots. 
# working with Prof.  Ravi Balasubramanian
### 1. working on introducing soft materials to robot grasping and manipulation. 
I am interested in modeling the behavior of soft graspers when grasping different objects and precisely controlling them.
