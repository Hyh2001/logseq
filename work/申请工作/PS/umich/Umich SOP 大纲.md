# teacher interested
## Prof. Kenn Oldham
I am interested working with Prof. Kenn Oldham on his soft robotics project. 
### 1.  I want to work with Prof. Kenn Oldham on building piezoelectric microactuators
1. It concurs with my interest on accurately controlling soft robots. I am interested in specifically design shapes of piezoelectric robots to better convert electrical energy to robot motion. 
### 2. I am interested in battery modeling and control
1. It concurs with my research on better modeling power supply and soft robots. I want to investigate on which model of batteries better suitable for supplying electricity for soft robots.  
## Prof. Ramanarayan Vasudevan
### 1. I also want to work with Prof. Vasudevan on researching how to precisely modeling soft robots. 
1. This project is mostly suitable for me to research on the soft robot control problem.  I will learn to build precise models of soft robots and apply them to facilitate building control algorithms.
