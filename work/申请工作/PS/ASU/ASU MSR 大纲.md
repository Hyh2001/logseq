# ASU is one of the best in the field of robotics. 
I will work with the most professional people in this field in the world. Thus I can build a compact understanding of robotics which will facilitate my achieving career plan by communicating with them. 
# courses interested
### 1. Nonlinear control
Working on nonlinear control will facilitate
### 2.  wearable and smart sensors

# working with Prof. Heni Ben Amor
Prof. Heni Ben Amor's research interests well accord with my interest on using haptic system to better control robot operations. 
### 1. Working on using haptic feedback to help human-robot teaming
I am interested in applying haptics systems to better control and thus they can team with humans more efficiently and can accomplish more complicate works. 

# working with Prof. WenLong Zhao
I am interested in working with Prof.  WenLong Zhao on two topics
### 1. working on wearable robots like protheses 
It is good for me to work with Prof. Zhao on more efficiently to teach protheses to perform new moves
### 2. working on soft robotics 
I want to working on building dexterous soft robots that can well assist human to accomplish complicate tasks. 

# working with Prof. Thomas Sugar
I am interested in working with Prof. Thomas Sugar on building more advanced rehabilitation robots.
