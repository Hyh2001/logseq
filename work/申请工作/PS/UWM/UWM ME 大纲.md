# structure
## want to be a robotic engineer
## why control and planning in robotics
I believe that this area is the core of whole robotic fields. Every aspects of robotics will finally relevant and be influenced by robot control and path planning. To apply computer vision algorithms, we need to ease vibrations of robots in order to acquire clearer visual data. To test viability of specific mechanical structures, we should specifically design control algorithms to facilitate their use.  Thus, to be a scientist that can grasp key ideas of every aspects of robotics, it is good to begin with robot control and planning. 
## mostly interested in legged robotics
## legged robots and soft sensors 
apply self-designed soft sensors to distinguish between terrains and thus specifically design control algorithms for them
# why Prof. XiaoBin Xiong
## 1. Prof. XiaoBin Xiong's research interests well accord my research interests. 
## 2 . I am interested in joining a lab at its foundation time. 
Building a lab by myself can facilitate my understanding on experiment tools and procedures. Experience of building and setting robots will help me avoid more obstacles when using them to do research. 
## 3 . I will chase for a diverse set of skills by learning with t Prof.Xiong
