## medical robotics 
This course will facilitate my understanding of medical robotics. I want to learn to specifically design soft sensors to facilitate their using on medical robots 
## Nonlinear Systems & Control
This course will give me the required knowledge on modelling and controlling soft materials and thus build tools that need more accurate performance with them.
