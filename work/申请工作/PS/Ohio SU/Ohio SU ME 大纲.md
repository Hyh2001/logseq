# The school is one of the best in the field of robotics

# Interested courses
1. Polymer Smart Materials and Material Systems - Advanced Modeling and Characterization
2. Mechanics and Control of Robots 
# working with professor  Ayonga Hereid
1. His research interests well concord with my interest in working on design specific mechanical structures for legged robots. 
2. Working on control and planning problems is what I am chasing for


# working with professor Steve Niezgoda
1. Prof. Steve Niezgoda's research well accords my interest in accurately modeling the relationship between soft robot motion and material deformations. 
2.  Working with Prof. Steve Niezgoda can well extend my understanding on how to model Soft materials and thus design more suitable materials for robots.
