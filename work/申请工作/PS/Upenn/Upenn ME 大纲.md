# Upenn is one of the best in the field of nanotechnology

# interested courses
1. Mechanical Properties of Macro/Nanoscale Materials
2. Electrochemistry for Energy, Nanofabrication, and Sensing

# working with Prof. Jordan R.Rawy
### working on geometric control of nonlinear behavior of soft materials
This topic is well accordant with my interest in precisely controlling behaviors of soft materials.
### Working on building autonomous soft robots 
This topic will facilitate my envision on applying soft materials to various areas.
# working with Prof. David Issadore
### working on applying nanotechnology in medical related fields.
Applying nanotechnology to ease prices of medical treatment for poor patients. Think it really meaningful to work on this project. Helping the development of society is what I am chasing for as a nanotechnology engineer.
