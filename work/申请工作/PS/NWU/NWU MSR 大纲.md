# NWU is the best in rehabilitation robotics. 
I will work with the most professional people in this field in the world.

# course interested
1. optimal control for Nonlinear systems
2. Control of human limbs and their artificial replacement

# wroking with Prof. Edward Colgate
Prof. Edward Colgate's research interest attracts me a lot. Many of his projects will facilitate my research on haptic feedback system and its applications. 
1. I want to work with Prof. Edward Colgate on haptic feedback and its application on protheses and other robots. Learning on advanced feedback system design and manufacturing is what I need to achieve my career goals
2. I am also interested in the concept of "cobot" and their influence on human machine interaction. 
# working with Prof. Ryan Truby
Prof. Ryan Truby's research interests are appealing too . Many of his projects will facilitate my research interest on the influence of different mechanical structures of soft robots on using machine learning algorithms to control them. 
1. I want to work with Prof. Ryan Truby on his project in building novel soft robots and using machine learning algorithms to facilitate controlling them.
