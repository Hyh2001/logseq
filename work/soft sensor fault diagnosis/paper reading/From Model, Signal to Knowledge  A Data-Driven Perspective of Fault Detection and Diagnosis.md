The purpose of this paper is to review on various fault detection and diagnosis(FDD) techniques. This paper classify the FDD techniques into three categories: model-based online data-driven method, signal-based methods and knowledge-based history data-driven method.  
# develop history of FDD 
The method of FDD develops from primitive methods to model-based method and signal-based method. These two methods are nearly at the same time. Later with the introduction of machine learning algorithms, knowledge-based method is generated. 
# composition of a FDD system 
data and understanding of data
