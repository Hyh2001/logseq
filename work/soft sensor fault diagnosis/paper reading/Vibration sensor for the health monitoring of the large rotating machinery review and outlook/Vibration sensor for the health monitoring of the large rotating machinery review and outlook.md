Vibration sensors can be divided into two categories: contact and non-contact. Contact vibration sensors include three types: piezoelectric sensor(see [[piezoelectric vibration sensor]], [[FBG]](fiber Bragg grating) sensor and the interferometric optical sensor. Non-contact vibration sensors include five types: the [[eddy current sensor]], the reflective [[optical fiber sensor]], the fiber tip-timing sensor, the non-contact FBG vibration sensor and the laser doppler vibrometer.
