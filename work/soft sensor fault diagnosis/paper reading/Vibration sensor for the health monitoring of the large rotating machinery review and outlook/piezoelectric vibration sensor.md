There are several shortcomings of piezoelectric vibration sensors:
1. Installation on the casing of large rotating machinery may cause an overlap in the fault signal.
2. Needed to be powered by the extra power supplies
3. susceptible to electromagnetic interference. 
4. charge leakage and the integrating circuit drift
