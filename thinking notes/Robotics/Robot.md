A robot is a [[mechanism]], it has some specific structures for performing works. When working on robots, the first thing we want to know of them is: where is the robot? We use [[configuration]] to answer this problem. Each [[configuration]] can be represented by $n$ numbers. The smallest number of $n$ numbers is [[degree of freedom]]. For the numbers that are given other than the $n$ numbers, we say that they are [[redundant]] constraints.  For all the robots, they can have different [[configuration]]s which contain $n$ numbers for each, and all the [[configuration]]s combined represented  [[configuration space]]. Therefore, we are interested in how to represent a [[configuration space]]. (details see [[configuration space]]). More than [[configuration space]], there are two spaces that are relevant to the [[end effector]] of robots called [[task space]] and [[workspace]].
