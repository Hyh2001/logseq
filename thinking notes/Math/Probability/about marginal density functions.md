We calculate the marginal density function for a joint continuous random variable by integrating one of its variable. Thus it is like integrating along a line. ==what is the real meaning of this function?==  I think the answer of it is like for all values of another parameter, how this parameter influence the probability.  ==Another question is about that for a point of a continuous random variable, we say that it does not have a [[probability]] attach to it, but for a line it should be the same, but we actually can have a value, why?==  ==The answer is that we still get a density rather that an probability!!!!!!!==
