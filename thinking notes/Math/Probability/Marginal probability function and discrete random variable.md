What is their relationship? Are they talking about the same thing? ==I think they are talking about the same thing. Considering drawing a ball from a bag consisting of red blue and white balls. Let $X$ denote the number of red ball drawn, $Y$ for blue.  $P\{X,Y\} = \frac{C^n_xC^m_yC^a_{t-x-y}}{C^{n+m+a}_t}$, P\{X\} is the sum of all possible values of $Y$==     ([[marginal distribution]] )
